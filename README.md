# Knowledge-based-Citation-Reasoning-for-Biomedical-Domain
This work aims to explain or help understand the citation relationship between two papers by constructing a visual knowledge graph. 

For example, if article A studies a disease X, and article B explores a drug Y, and while drug Y has a therapeutic effect on disease X, then we would like to extract a triple like (drug X, therapy, disease Y) and construct a knowledge graph, which in turn helps to explain the citation associations between article A and article B
